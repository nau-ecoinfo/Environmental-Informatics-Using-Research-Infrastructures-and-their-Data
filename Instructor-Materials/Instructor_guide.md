LI = Lead Instructor

PI = Programming Instructor

TA = Teaching Assistant

See the suggested syllabus and digital textbook fro references to lecture, unit, and assignment content.

Course meetings are designed based on a 3 credit-hour, semester-long course (i.e. 15 weeks with 2, 1.5 hour meetings per week). The organization of the course may be altered to reflect varying schedules.

It is recommended that student questions be directed to a course chat-room (e.g. Gitter, Slack) or mailing list to reduce instructor workload by allowing students to answer each other's questions, particularly if there is no PI or TA.

### Day 1, Chapter 0-1

-   LI covers introduction to Ecoinformatics and the purpose of the course ([Pre-Course Setup: Ecoinformatics Tools](https://nau-ecoinfo.github.io/INF550-textbook/pre-course-setup-ecoinformatics-tools.html#pre-course-skills-setup)), syllabus (if applicable), and course expectations ([0.6 How we will be Conducting this Course](https://nau-ecoinfo.github.io/INF550-textbook/pre-course-setup-ecoinformatics-tools.html#how-we-will-be-conducting-this-course)) (\~15 minutes).

-   LI directs students to post questions about course content to a course chat-room or mailing list (if applicable, \~ 3 minutes).

-   PI or LI covers resources to catch up if some of the required skill are rusty or missing and git assignment ([0.7.1: A git introduction](https://nau-ecoinfo.github.io/INF550-textbook/pre-course-setup-ecoinformatics-tools.html#exercises)) (\~ 10 minutes).

-   LI covers [Chapter 1: Why 'Ecoinformatics'?](https://nau-ecoinfo.github.io/INF550-textbook/why-ecoinformatics.html) (\~ 30 minutes).

-   Overview of course framework ([1.1 The Framework of this Course](https://nau-ecoinfo.github.io/INF550-textbook/why-ecoinformatics.html#the-framework-of-this-course)) and final project ([1.2 Final Course Project: Proposed Derived Data Product](https://nau-ecoinfo.github.io/INF550-textbook/why-ecoinformatics.html#final-course-project-proposed-derived-data-product)) (\~ 15-20 minutes).

-   One or two example assignemnts that exemplify what is expected (if applicable, \~ 5 minutes).

### Day 2, Chapter 2

-   PI or LI leads a check-in on last lecture's git assignment ([Exercise 0.1: A Git Introduction](https://nau-ecoinfo.github.io/INF550-textbook/pre-course-setup-ecoinformatics-tools.html#exercises), \~ 3-5 minutes).

-   Sections [2.2](https://nau-ecoinfo.github.io/INF550-textbook/introduction-to-neon-its-data.html#the-neon-project-mission-design)-[2.5](https://nau-ecoinfo.github.io/INF550-textbook/introduction-to-neon-its-data.html#how-neon-collects-data); LI (and guest speaker, if available) introduces NEON , its mission, its design (\~ 10-20 minutes).

-   **Guest Lecture**: [Donal O'Leary - Introduction to the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)](https://nau-ecoinfo.github.io/INF550-textbook/introduction-to-neon-its-data.html#introduction-to-the-national-ecological-observatory-netowrk-neon)

    -   Donal O'Leary, Research Scientist, Education and Outreach, NEON - Battelle, outlines NEON's Ten Big Ideas, talks about program funding and the Battelle takeover, and explains NEON data availability, site selection, and constraints.

-   LI or PI briefly goes over NEON API tokens ([2.7 Hands on: Accessing NEON Data & User Tokens](https://nau-ecoinfo.github.io/INF550-textbook/introduction-to-neon-its-data.html#hands-on-accessing-neon-data-user-tokens))

    -   Students will need a Token for the hands on coding exercise in the next class. Instruct them to obtain one by following the directions in section 2.7.1-2.7.4 of the textbook. Students do not need to complete [2.7.3 Use the NEON token in neonUtilities](https://nau-ecoinfo.github.io/INF550-textbook/introduction-to-neon-its-data.html#things-youll-need-to-complete-this-tutorial).

    -   Assign the firt part of [2.10.1 NEON Coding Lab - TOS Vegetation Structure](https://nau-ecoinfo.github.io/INF550-textbook/introduction-to-neon-its-data.html#exercise-2.1-neon-coding-lab---tos-vegetation-structure), in which students obtain a NEON API token.

-   If time permits: go over the first assignment as a class.

### Day 3, Chapter 2

- PI introduces 'best practices' for taking live coding notes and git ignore (\~ 10 minutes).
  - The recorded lecture below and many that follow include a coding demonstration ([2.8 Hands On: NEON TOS Data]())
